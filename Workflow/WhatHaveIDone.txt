A performance test on HDWPSRRating probability strategy via Haville.py. The measure I used are prediction precision and historical PnL.

3. probOddsPoolStrategy.ipynb

The task assigned today, unfinished. I am still stuck with the data. There is no odds information, and I don't know what is "pool_type" means.
Please check the notebook, there is something I thought might save your time. Wish you good luck!!!
